# VVER1000-for-Version5

Sets of input files for DRAGON and DONJON to simulate the IAEA VVER fuel management benchmark. Normal users should start with the DRAGON files. Once the DRAGON calculations are properly set up, the COMPO files for DONJON can be calculated. The DONJON input files are delivered with a small COMPO file so that an example DONJON calculation can be done.
